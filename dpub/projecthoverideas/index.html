<h2>If It Doesn't Exist on the Internet, It Doesn't Exist<h2>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>I'm going to start right out by saying it: If it doesn't exist on the internet, it doesn't exist. I used to say this hyperbolically but as time has gone on, it's proved to be a truism, perhaps the paradigmatic truism of our times.<br>
<br>
You might deny this until you realize that much of your self-worth is derived from <a href="https://www.google.com.au">Googling yourself</a>; if you don't exist on the internet, you don't exist.<br>
<br>
You get frustrated as I do when you are researching in front of your computer and what you're looking for doesn't show up on Google. Perhaps we are at the root of the problem.<br>
<br>
It is our obligation as educators and intellectuals to make sure that the bulk of our production ends up there, preferably with free and unfettered access to all. This means not making materials available only for those affiliated with our institution, our students, or our colleagues, but giving free and unfettered access for all. Doing so means posting our works on the world wide web so that anyone, anywhere, at any time can have access to them. In this way, we will ensure that our work exists.<br><p>

<h2>A Second Life: Living Online<h2>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>Second Life (SL), if you haven’t already heard, is an online virtual world with over one million <a href="http://secondlife.com">registrations</a>. It’s a 3D space that you enter and move around. Unlike massively multiplayer role-playing games like World of Warcraft, Linden Labs (the company behind SL) decided to offer no game, no missions, no tasks or roles to play. It is up to the residents of SL not only to inhabit but create it and everything you can do in it, pixel by pixel. So what do the SL residents, who are on average 32 years of age, choose to create?<br>
<br>
In Hinduism, an avatar refers to the embodiment of an immortal being. In virtual worlds, an avatar refers to the embodied representation of each player or resident. I have an avatar, but cannot claim any access to divine knowledge. And, unlike the imaginative incarnations of Hindu beings, such as Hayagriva’s human body with a horse head, the bodies preferred by SL residents are surprisingly vapid. Most avatars in SL are ‘ideal’ forms such as tall, slim, glamorous women and men with washboard abdominals and even musclier arms. Unlike real life, it is harder to put on weight, age and be ugly in SL. In order to corrupt your avatar you need to either tweak your appearance or buy another. You can look, dress and act any way you like in SL, for a price.<br>
<br>
You can choose another gender or species, various personae (<span class="image"> <img src="assets/images/bradpitt.jpg" width="50px"></span> <span class="text">Brad Pitt</span>, <span class="image"> <img src="assets/images/yoda.png" width="55px"></span><span class="text">Yoda</span>), an abstract installation or create your own. Your decisions about how you portray yourself in this world are important because other avatars judge you on those choices. Many residents choose idealised forms for the experience—how it feels and how you are treated. As well as a body, SL residents can buy clothes, hair, hats and nail polish. Everything you try on fits: jeans, dresses, jumpers, tuxedos. These personalisation practices are not unique to SL or virtual worlds, but the facility to be infinitely bold is embedded in the option to program yourself, literally. SL also provides the capacity to weave this construction beyond the avatar to a home and lifestyle.<br>

<h2>Where is the Internet?<h2>
</div>

<div class="idea">
<p>Billions of people around the world use the Internet every day, but it’s likely few outside of the IT industry could give a definitive answer to the question, “Where is the Internet?” It’s a query that many may never even enter the consideration of most Internet users, beyond researching a hosting provider or vague notions of “cyberspace” or memories of AOL floppies from the ’90s.<br>
<br>
Yet despite its ephemeral nature, the Internet does indeed have a physical home—one that encircles the globe. Spread across almost 75 million interconnected servers, the network we now call the Internet connects more than five billion (with some estimates hovering closer to ten billion) computers, smartphones, and other devices. That’s a far cry from its ancestor, the ARPANET project of the 1960s, which began as a 2.4 kbps connection between two enormous university computers.<br>
<br>
Today, the connections that power the backbone of the Internet push data at close to the speed of light along more than half a million miles of <a href="https://qz.com/657898/this-map-shows-the-explosive-growth-of-underwater-cables-the-power-the-global-internet/">undersea cable</a>. That’s enough cable to circle the Earth more than 22 times, or to reach from Earth to the moon—and back again. Even with such enormous power and reach, however, experts from the <a href="http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/41.aspx#.WQWiKXer1PP">International Telecommunications Union (ITU)</a> predict only 40% of the total population of Earth will be online by the end of 2013. That number will likely climb much higher as satellite-based Internet technology becomes more practical and coverage expands to areas currently inaccessible by traditional landlines.<br>
